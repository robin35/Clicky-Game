# clicky-game

Thank you for visiting my repository. This project uses React to build a memory game. 

Here’s how it works:

    The objective of the Game of Memory is to not click the same image twice.  The images are similar so you will have to pay close attention.
    	To start the game, click any image.
    	For each image clicked, you will receive 1 point.
    	However, if you click the same image twice, you lose.
    	The game keeps track of you score and your best (or highest) score.
    
This game can be enjoyed by everyone.

Good Luck!
